This dashboard accompanies the **Parakeet Call Preprocessing Pipeline**, which performs:

1. Reading and standardizing Raven selection tables (`*.txt`)
2. Joining recording-level and call-level metadata
3. Filtering low-quality or noisy calls
4. Extracting acoustic features via `warbleR::spectro_analysis()`
5. Reducing feature space using PCA
6. Clustering calls using Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs)
7. Identifying ‚Äúcontact call‚Äù clusters based on posterior probability thresholds (‚â• 0.80)

The Streamlit app provides an interactive overview of each step, along with reproducibility guidance and summaries of my pipeline's results.

R source code for the pipeline cannot be provided due to this pertaining to a lab project as well.
